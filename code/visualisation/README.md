# Visualization Repository README

## Team-Trein Visualization

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing train routes in the Netherlands. The visualization.py script takes a CSV file containing train routes and displays them on a map of the Netherlands. The visualization includes scatter plots of coordinates, connections between places, and trajectories of trains (different colors for different tracks).

## File Structure

- `code/visualisation.py`: Main script for visualization.
- `data/CoordinatesShort.csv`: CSV file containing short-format coordinates.
- `data/CoordinatesLong.csv`: CSV file containing long-format coordinates.
- `data/ConnectiesHolland.csv`: CSV file containing connections for Holland.
- `data/ConnectiesNL.csv`: CSV file containing connections for the Netherlands.
- `code/visualisation/map_netherlands.jpg`: Image file for the map of the Netherlands.
