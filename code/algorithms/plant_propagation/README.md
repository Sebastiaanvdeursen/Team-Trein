# Plant Propagation
### by Team-Trein
## Explanation of the algorithm
This algorithm tries to fit the plant propagation algorithm on the RailNL object.
It does this using a couple heuristics and algorithms we created/ decided upon, furthermore it performs selection by tournament style.
First we start by creating a starting population of 30 and select the 5 best as the start position. We do this because we have noticed that the start is very important for the end_score
