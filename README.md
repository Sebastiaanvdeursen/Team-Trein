Dit is onze README!

Code:
Run the code by typing python main.py large/small algorithm size. You can also opt to not include size, then one iteration will be ran.
By typing large you run the chosen algorithm on the Netherlands and by typing small you only use Holland. For algorithms you can choose
between find_p, annealing, random, random_optim, greedy_random, greedy_random_max, greedy_optim, hill_climbing, hill_climbing/greedy,
hill_climbing/greedy_max, hill_climbing/greedy_optim, hill_climbing/greedy_optim_max or double_greedy.
